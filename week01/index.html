      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is <strong>Armando Rebaza</strong>, and I was born and raised in Arequipa, Peru, a city known for its strong traditions and community values.
        I am married to my wife, Jessica, who has been my constant support and partner throughout our life together.
        We have been blessed with three wonderful children, who are an important part of everything we do as a family.
        Our families embraced education, faith, and service, which shaped the way we raise our children today.
        We enjoy spending time together, traveling, learning, and supporting one another’s goals.
        My family continues to inspire me to grow personally, professionally, and spiritually.
